> A complete re-write of warmshowers.org.

## Why?

I love warmshowers.org, but I feel the technical choices made during development were made out of convenience, not because they were the right choices.

I would love to see more contributions to warmshowers.org, but was frustrated myself with having to learn out-dated frameworks, having very little documentation and pretty much nothing in the way of quality assurance.

## How?

 - PHP7 backend (which is pretty much only an API)
 - TypeScript/JavaScript frontend (all website related stuff, templating etc.)

## Features

 - a user has a username, email, address, phone number, latitude and longitude  and password
 - an address consists of a city, zip code, country, street and house number
 - a user can find other users by username, name, email and city
 - a user can write messages to other users
 - a user can write a request to other users
 - a user has a profile
 - a user can reply to a message
 - a new user has to sign up
